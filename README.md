# Good Course Reads

What would be good books to accompany courses which may not otherwise have readings which focus on the history, human element, or other interesting aspect of a subject? Emphasis on books that are not textbooks. Inspired by a [Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/119537612?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1).
